Description: Demographic estimation and forecasting, using Bayesian 
    hierarchical models and demographic accounts.   The package contains
    general-purpose functions estimating and forecasting rates, counts, or 
    means, cross-classified by dimensions such as age, sex, region, and time.
    The methods can be applied to classic demographic problems, such as 
    forecasting mortality, but also to related problems as forecasting labour
    force participation, or estimating disease prevalence.  The methods work 
    with multiple datasets, noisy data, and missing data.
